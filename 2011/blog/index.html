<p>Given the strong response to Pycon India 2011 so far, the online registrations are now closed. We thank the community for their enthusiastic response and hope they have a very fruitful and enriching experience at Pycon India. 
</p>
<p>Given the likelihood that some people will still end up reaching the conference, we shall keep spot registrations open. The spot registration fees shall be Rupees 1000 for the event. Note that spot registration could be restricted based on capacity constraints.

<p>The Pycon India 2011 Schedule is now published at <a href="http://in.pycon.org/2011/schedule">http://in.pycon.org/2011/schedule</a> 
</p>
<p>The first day (Friday, September 16th is dedicated to tutorials), and the second and the third days (ie. Saturday and Sunday, September 17th and 18th) shall feature the keynote, talks and lightning talks. The same should be helpful in deciding which of the various talks and tutorials you might find most useful to attend.

<p>Even as we decide the detailed schedule for the event, we are receiving a number of queries with respect to the start and stop times, as people need to finalise their travel plans.
</p>
<p>Please note that the start and stop times for the sessions on September 16th, 17th and 18th will be 09:30 hrs and 18:00 hrs. The first day (16th) shall be reserved for tutorials exclusively. Thus all the talks will be conducted on 17th and 18th.
</p>
<p>To clarify, the tutorials and talks are marked differently (different background colour) on <a href="http://in.pycon.org/2011/talks">http://in.pycon.org/2011/talks</a> . Tutorials typically last three hours, whereas all talks are a little less than one hour in duration.
</p>
<p>The detailed tutorial/talk schedule is expected to be announced in about a weeks time.

<p>We are happy to announce a new initiative at the Pycon India 2011 web-site. This is an area on the site where you can create wikis that anyone can edit. We are calling these as 'Open Spaces'.
</p>
<p>The Open Space initiative is meant to help folks to plan ahead any BoF/coding activity they want to do together during Pycon India 2011. You can create and share wikis on the site which can be used to plan such activities ahead in time. 
</p>
<p>It could be as simple as hacking a game together on PyGame or as complex as trying to write a patch for working around GIL in Python (too ambitious ? :). Or maybe something more realistic such as working in a Django plugin or snippet or maybe something useful to community such as coming together to fix some bugs in Python 3.2. Or maybe simply hanging around in a room and talk of using Redis or Mongodb with Python and some of the more esoteric things you can do with them!
</p>
<p>It could be anything that you can think of under the sun and over the snake. But we welcome you to create your space under the Open spaces.
</p>
<p>Go and <a href="/2011/openspace">see for yourself</a> and give it a try!

<p>The final talk and tutorial selections have been decided, and the decisions have been communicated back to the submitters.
</p>
<p>The results are now published on the talks page at <a href="http://in.pycon.org/2011/talks">http://in.pycon.org/2011/talks</a> 
</p>
<p>Congratulations to all the selected authors. We look forward to your presentation at Pycon India 2011.
</p>
<p>Based on our experiences of some talks getting withdrawn for a variety of reasons, a few talks have been shortlisted as reserved. Should any of the speakers for the selected talks be unable to present, or withdraw their talk, we shall get in touch with the speakers of the reserved talks to offer them to step in. Note that such shortlisted talks continue to appear as &quot;under review&quot; on the talks page mentioned above.
</p>
<p>The talks are rated by the review team and the talks with the highest combined rating are selected. Many thanks to the entire review team for their efforts to get the selections out in time. 
</p>
<p>Note that all attendees (including selected authors, authors whose submissions could not be selected, and everyone else who wishes to attend) need to register. If not yet done, kindly do so at the earliest at <a href="http://in.pycon.org/2011/register">http://in.pycon.org/2011/register</a>
