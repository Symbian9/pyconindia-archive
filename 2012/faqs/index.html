      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    </div>
<p><strong>Q. Is it possible to cancel my tickets?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Do you really want to cancel tickets? PyCon India happens once a year and we are eager to meet you and share ideas and collaborate. If indeed you want to cancel tickets, then the answer is Yes. All you need to do is send an email to  <a href="mailto:tickets@in.pycon.org">tickets@in.pycon.org</a>  with the Order No. you received and the name of the attendee. </p>
<p><strong>Q. Do I need to register for tutorials separately?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Yes. </p>
<p><strong>Q. I did not register for the tutorials when I bought the ticket. How do I add tutorial option to my ticket now?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> If you forgot to register for tutorial when you bought the ticket(s), you can do so now. Visit <a href="http://pyconindia2012.doattend.com/get_addons">http://pyconindia2012.doattend.com/get_addons</a> . You will need your Ticket Number that will be present in the ticket emailed to you, and, Email Address that you used while registering for the PyCon India 2012. </p>
<p><strong>Q. Can I register directly at the venue?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Yes, you certainly can. However, we would recommend that you do it now as at venue registration will be Rs. 1500 for conference and 500 for tutorials. And moreover, you may be in a loss as we can not guarantee t-shirts for at venue registrations.</p>
<p><strong>Q. I see registrations are closed. I have not registered. Can I still attend PyCon India ?</strong><br><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Yes, you can. For details check above question.</p>
<p><strong>Q. Does tutorial speakers need to register for tutorials?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> No. If you have already registered, please email <a href="mailto:tickets@in.pycon.org">tickets@in.pycon.org</a> for processing refund.</p>
<p><strong>Q. Is there a prescribed format for the talk slides ? For example, can I upload the slides in PDF ?</strong><br><br><strong>A.</strong>  There is no suggested format for talk slides. You can upload in your favorite format whichever it is. It would be useful however if you stick to commonly used formats such as Word, Openoffice, PDF etc. <br><br><strong>Q. Is there any "official" presentation template for PyCon India ?</strong><br><br><strong>A.</strong> We don't prescribe any template. You are free to use any kind of presentation template for your slides.<br><br><strong>Q. Can I present a different set of slides than the one I uploaded to the site? Should the one I present be exactly the same as the one uploaded?</strong><br><br><strong>A.</strong> It would be good if the presentation you upload is the same as the one you present. However, if you need to make any small changes, it is okay as long as you make sure that the slides are not substantially different. Also it would be nice if you could sync the slide set to the site before you deliver your talk. If there is a substantial different between the two sets of slides, kindly inform the audience in advance.<br><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> <strong>How to upload presentations to the site ?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> We don't have support for presentation uploads yet. You can upload your presentation to a public site such as slideshare or google docs and copy/paste the URL into your talk's description.</p>
<p><strong>Q.Where or How do i save the link to the external presentation site ?</strong><br><strong>A.</strong>"Postfix "/edit" to the full URL of your talk after logging in to the site with the same userid that you used for submitting the talk. You should get a form with the required fields. Enter the required information and save."</p>
<p><strong>Q. I couldn't upload my slides for my talk to the site and need more time to do so. Does this affect the status of my talk ?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A</strong>. The last dates for slides upload is more of a guideline than a strict deadline. It is advisable to keep it. Your talk status doesn't change even if you are unable to upload the slides before the deadline due to some reason. We however request you to try and upload the slides before the conference. </p>
<p><strong>Q. Do I need to inform the audience of any prior setup or can it be done during the talk or tutorial ?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> For tutorials, we suggest that you edit your talk description and add the steps required for the tutorial attendees to prepare their computers before they come to the session. This would ensure that you don't waste precious time in setting up requirements during the session. </p>
<p><strong>Q. Do you have Laptop charging sockets in the room for all? My laptop doesn't give more than an hour of backup.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> We will have limited laptop charging points in the rooms. But we will try to provide few tables with lots of charging points somewhere at the venue. </p>
<p><strong>Q. Will the Internet and WiFi setup be good enought for the large crowd? Is it advisable to get datacards?</strong><br><br><strong>A. </strong>We have a good wifi setup, but only a 4MBPS line. If you have a data card, you should bring it along.<br><br><strong>Q. Is there an arrangement made for the Tutorial and Conference videos  record/Live Streaming?</strong><br><br><strong>A. </strong>We are video recording all the tutorials and talks. We will not be live streaming them.  However, we will upload the videos within a week's time <br><br><strong>Q. It is possible to watch the vidoes live?</strong><br><br><strong>A. </strong>Live watching will not be possible. However, we will upload the videos within a week's time. So, you can see it later at your convenience and as many times you wish. :)<br><br><strong>Q. Can I attend all the talks/tutorials? I see in your Pycon Schedule there are 5 rooms - A1, A2, A3, B1, B2. Is it possible to attend all the talks/tutorials?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. </strong>No, there are 5 parallel tracks for tutorials and 4 parallel tracks for talks. It is not possible to attend all of them. We suggest that you look at the tutorial and talk schedules and pick those sessions you want to attend and come prepared.</p>
