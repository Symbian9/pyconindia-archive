      <h3>Panel discussion on &#34;Python in education&#34; <small>August 25, 2013</small></h3>
    </div>
    <p>While many of us in the IT industry are intimately familiar with the advances Python is making on the tech. and business frontiers, we often don't see the work happening in other domains. Python has a reputation for being an excellent first language and very easy to study. The Kerala state governments <a href="http://itschool.gov.in">IT@school</a> program teaches Python to high school kids. The <a href="http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-06-03/news/39713973_1_class-xi-cbse-website-cbse">CBSE also has introduced Python as an option to C++</a> for high school students. The <a href="http://fossee.in/">FOSSEE.in</a> project introduces free and open source Python based tools to engineers and other people working in scientific domains. </p>
<p>This year, for the first time at PyCon India, we're putting together a panel of people who have been working in this area and giving them a forum to discuss the topic. The panel will consist of 3 experts on the stage who will have a discussion about the role of Python in the education domain on stage. Questions will be selected in advance to guide the discussion and there will be an open Q/A session at the end. </p>
<p>The participants for the panel will be. </p>
