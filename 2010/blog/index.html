<p>Though we don't have the concept of tracks in this year's Pycon, the talks have been assigned to each hall roughly according to some topic categorization.
</p>
<p>Here is the how every talk hall is assigned to talks accordingly to category.
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
     <strong>Auditorium (ESB2 Seminar-Hall 1)</strong> - Apart from the Keynote, the auditorium will hold talks in the topics of 3D/Algorithms/Compilers/Database/Hardware/Mobile/Windows &amp; Open-source Python Projects.
 </li>

 <li>
     <strong>Lecture Hall 1 (ESB2 Seminar-Hall 2)</strong> - Almost all talks on Internet, Search &amp; Web Application frameworks is in this hall (except introductory ones). Apart from that this hall will host talks related to Python/Conference Advocacy and E-inclusion.  <br />
 </li>

 <li>
     <strong>Lecture Hall 2 (Hi-Tech Hall)</strong> - All introductory or newbie talks are scheduled in this hall irrespective of topic. Also, this hall will host talks related to Testing/GUI &amp; Image Processing.
 </li>

 <li>
     <strong>Lecture Hall 3 (ESB1 Computer Lab, 3rd Floor)</strong> - The FOSSEE scientific/engineering workshop. This will be a continuous session and attending only part of it will bring only limited benefit. It's specially designed for engineers and scientists. For details, please refer to <a href="/2010/blog/25-python-for-science-and-engineering-workshop-by-fossee">this blog post</a>. 
 </li>
</ul>
<p>The locations of the halls will be displayed at the venue and volunteers will be around to help you find the halls. 
</p>
<p>So if you don't have the schedule at hand, you know approximately where to head to if you have a topic in mind.

<p>Here is some information that will be useful for delegates traveling to the conference, especially from those outside Bangalore.
</p>
<p>The main hot-spots to reach MSRIT are <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=14696817273378848526&amp;q=KBS+Bus+Station,+Bangalore&amp;hl=en&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=src:pplink&amp;ei=YVGcTL62NJaWkAXiz9zVBg&amp;sig2=fb5MNQE74nWftUpIIF5Gvg">Majestic Bus Stand (also called Kempegowda Bus Station or &quot;KBS&quot; in short)</a>, <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=&amp;vps=5&amp;jsv=278a&amp;sll=13.154376,77.706299&amp;sspn=0.51083,0.922852&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;geocode=FQ19xgAdiIufBA&amp;split=0">Malleshwaram</a>, <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=16863372394875297164&amp;q=City+Market,+Bangalore&amp;hl=en&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=src:pplink&amp;ei=dVKcTJWlBIWRkQWu2ZiPBA&amp;sig2=q7gvFphqbMKE2PqFqh2f0w">K.R Market</a> and <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=&amp;vps=12&amp;jsv=278a&amp;sll=12.956868,77.625555&amp;sspn=0.12781,0.230713&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;geocode=FVTMxgAdwkKfBA&amp;split=0">Yeshwantpur</a>.   <br />

</ul>
<p>If you are taking a flight to Bangalore, the best option is to take a bus or taxi from the airport to Majestic and take one of these buses to the venue. (BMTC operates a number of buses from Airport to different parts of the city. Of course you can always ask the taxi driver to drop you directly at the venue if you choose to). 
</p>
<p>Those taking a train to Bangalore can get down at Bangalore City Railway Station (which is directly opposite KBS), cross the road to KBS and take one of the buses above.
</p>

</p>
<ul>
 <li>

 </li>
</ul>
<p>People coming from far away such as Whitefield, Marathalli, Sarjapur, HAL areas can reach Mekhri Circle and take an auto from there to the venue. (The same option is also available for those coming from the airport, if they chose to).
</p>
<p>Those coming from Hosur, Electronics-City to the city can take a bus from Bommanahalli to Corporation circle and take bus <strong>98-D</strong> to MSRIT. The following buses go from Bommanahalli to Corporation.
</p>
<ul>

<p>The honorable Supreme court of India has deferred the Ayodhya case decision by a week. Read the news at <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/supreme-court-defers-ayodha-verdict-by-a-week-54235">NDTV</a>.

<p>So any cloud hanging over Pycon India this week-end is cleared. We <strong>are going to have</strong> the conference this week-end as planned with no changes. This is the final notification from us on this matter.

<p>As many of you must have heard, the verdict of the Ayodhya case might be delivered on this Friday (24 September). Many <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/Karnataka-schools-colleges-shut-on-Sep-24-25/Article1-603459.aspx">news sources</a> indicate that the Govt. of Karnataka has declared a prohibition on 24 and 25 of the month under section 144 which prevents gatherings. This might affect the conference. 
</p>
<p>We have no official stance on this yet since there's still some vagueness regarding the situation. We will keep you posted on the situation and will do our best to prevent disappointment. Please keep your eyes on the <a href="http://twitter.com/pyconindia">twitter feed</a> and this blog to get updates.

<p>The <a href="/2010/schedule">talks schedule</a> has been published on the site. If you are speaker for the conference, look at the schedule and find out the day, time and hall where your talk has been slotted. I have taken into account all specific scheduling requests I received while scheduling the talks. Further changes in schedules are not possible unless there is a cancellation or withdrawal of talks.
</p>
<p>The keynote by David begins at the <strong>Auditorium</strong> on <strong>Sep 25</strong> at <strong>9.30 am</strong>. There are no talks scheduled in the other halls during this time since we would like everyone present to be free to listen to David's keynote. Lunch timings are from 12.30-1.30 pm every day. There will also be short tea break between 4.15-4.30 pm. Talks end every day at 5.30 pm.

<p>All the content (videos and slides) of the conference will be available online for people who want them. Last year however, there were several requests from people to provide recordings of the events so that they could watch them offline.
</p>
<p>This year, we have partnered with <a href="http://vodex.in">Vodex technologies</a> to distribute the DVDs of the presentations and videos of the conference. The DVDs being sold will contain an HTML5 based application which will synchronise the talk and the presentation. 
</p>
<p>The DVDs will be sold at Rs. 125 per DVD. This is not included as part of the registration fees and interested attendees will have to purchase the DVDs separately. Once the conference is over, the videos will be processed, the DVDs burnt and couriered to the attendees who have purchased them. 
</p>
<p>Vodex will be putting up a stall at the conference where interested attendees can register and pay for the DVDs.

<p>There seems to be some wrong information (at least I saw one tweet on this) circulating that talk schedules are already put up. This is NOT correct. Talk schedules will be put up around a week before the conference. We have only put up the selected talks list which has been available in the <a href="/2010/talks">Talks list</a> for some time already.
</p>
<p>If you want specific scheduling for your talk (scheduling on a specific day at a specific time etc) then please send an email regarding the same at the email address <i>abpillai at gmail dot com</i>. Valid reasons for this could be that you are arriving late into the city, you are not coming for the first day due to some personal reasons etc. We cannot accommodate all such requests, but will try to do so for those who are coming from outside Bangalore if valid reasons are quoted in the email.

<p>A lot of questions have been coming in regarding paying offline for the event. This post is to clarify the situation. 
</p>
<ul>
 <li><p>The preferred way to pay is online. It takes a few minutes to do and there's no headache, extra book keeping for anyone. Please try to do this.
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>If this is a problem, please book a ticket using the register link above and transfer the money into our bank account. You can either transfer it online using netbanking or go to an AXIS bank branch and do it there. Our bank account details (account holder name, IFSC etc.) are at <a href="http://ipss.org.in/">http://ipss.org.in/</a>. Once you transfer the money, please mail <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#99;&#111;&#110;&#116;&#97;&#99;&#116;&#64;&#105;&#110;&#46;&#112;&#121;&#99;&#111;&#110;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;">&#99;&#111;&#110;&#116;&#97;&#99;&#116;&#64;&#105;&#110;&#46;&#112;&#121;&#99;&#111;&#110;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a> with your ticket/order number. We will mark the ticket as paid and you'll get an email. 
</p>

 </li>

 <li><p>The final option is to pay at the venue. This is not preferred and you'll miss the keynote presentations and many other good talks in the morning.

<p>Questions have come up as to whether accepted speakers have to register on the website and pay. The answer is <strong>yes</strong>. The registration costs are just enough to cover the food and swag costs and so we require that all the delegates (including selected speakers) register and pay.

<p>I am getting a lot of requests in my email and phone regarding the deadline for talk slides upload for approved talks on the website. Initially this was announced as August 31 2010 (today). 
</p>
<p>To give the authors enough time to prepare their slides, we have <strong>postponed this to September 10 2010</strong>. If you are an author with an approved talk for Pycon India 2010, please start work on your talk slides at the earliest and kindly make sure that you upload the slides before the deadline.
</p>
<p>To upload a slide for your talk, visit your talk URL and go the &quot;Files&quot; section. Click on the link that says &quot;upload a file&quot; which will take you to the upload form. Enter the required information and click on &quot;Upload&quot;. One of the fields is the secret password for your talk which has been emailed to you separately earlier. If you don't have the secret password for your talk, you can get in touch with me.
</p>
<p>We prefer open formats namely ODF formatted slides, but you can also upload powerpoint slides with a &quot;.ppt&quot; extension. Please refrain from using formats which are not yet commonly used (for example &quot;pptx&quot;). Also, if you are an Apple keynote user, please try to export your presentation to ODF format before uploading. PDF is also okay, but kindly refrain from using formats like RTF, HTML etc.

<p>The early bird rates will not be available after August 31. Please register before that to avail reduced costs. The prices will increase after that. 
</p>
<p>While we will be collecting the registration costs at the venue, it's best that payment is done in advance. The queues at the registration counter might be long and you risk missing out on the keynote and morning talks.

<p>We have decided to extend the date for announcing the list of selected talks for Pycon India 2010 to <strong>August 20 2010</strong>.
</p>
<p>The main reason for this is to give enough time for reviewers for evaluation since the number of talks submitted was rather higher than originally estimated. Also, this should give enough time for those authors who we have requested to re-submit their talks and haven't yet done so.
</p>
<p>If you are an author who has submitted a talk, please wait for the final announcement on August 20. If your talk has been requested for a re-submission, kindly resubmit it before <strong>Tuesday August 17 2010</strong> to make sure it is considered for the final list of talks.

<p>We have started the talk review process from today. Talks will be reviewed and selected by a committee of reviewers. Each talk will be reviewed by a group of four reviewers, each one rating the talk on a scale of 25. The total score for the talk is the sum of all scores by the reviewers on a scale of 100.

<p>We have had an amazing response to our <a href="/2010/cfp">call for proposals</a> from the Python community in India. On the closing bell, as on 00:00 hours on August 01 2010, a total of <a href="/2010/talks">80 talks</a> have been submitted on a wide variety of topics. 
</p>
<p>The call for proposals was <a href="/2010/blog/1-call-for-proposals-is-open">announced</a> on June 12. The CFP saw little activity in June, but picked up steam towards the second half of July with most of the talks submitted in the last week. As many as 35 talks were submitted in the closing week of the CFP, which accounts for nearly half of the total submissions. The last day of the CFP saw close to 20 talks submitted.
</p>
<p>This has been a tremendous response from the Python community in India, showing that interest in Python is alive and flourishing in India. We thank everyone who submitted a proposal for their valuable support and contribution to the conference.
</p>
<p>The reviews will be starting in a couple of days and we will be publishing information on the review process before that, so watch this space for further updates.

<p>The time we've all been waiting for! PyCon India 2010 registrations are open. The early bird registrations last till the end of August so please make sure you register on time. The rates will increase after that and spot registrants might not get any swag.
</p>
<p>We understand that there are a number of students who might find it hard to pay online. We will be collecting the money for the registrations offline during the user group meetups at the various cities in July and in August before the conference. You can pay there. If you're in a city that doesn't have a user group, this is a great chance to start one.
</p>
<p>All the participants (including speakers) have to register so please do so. If you have any questions, please direct them to <a href="mailto:contact@in.pycon.org">contact@in.pycon.org</a> or tweet them to <a href="http://twitter.com/pyconindia">@pyconindia</a>.
</p>
<p>So, what are you waiting for? Go to <a href="/2010/register">http://in.pycon.org/2010/register</a> and register right away!

<p>PyCons throughout the world are purely volunteer run. It takes all kinds of talent to get a successful conference going.
</p>
<p>At this point, we need artists. People who have the ability to create works of art. Our main form of advertising and publicity <em>after</em> the conference is our T-shirt. We need it to be really good looking and eye catching. 
</p>
<p>The logo should look good and be identifiable at low and high resolutions. It would be nice if the uploads were of very high resolution (or in a scalable format like svg). 
</p>
<p>So, all you artistically inclined Pythonistas out there, please contribute logos and T-shirt designs. You can upload them <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/PyConIndia2010/Artwork">here</a> along with your name and we'll pick the best ones with a community vote. We'll keep the doors open for the whole of July and after that put the designs to a vote.

<p>We're having one track during PyCon India specifically dedicated to first time speakers and newcomers to the Python community.
</p>
<p>This track will consist only of talks by people who have not had much experience speaking in public. The subjects covered will be basic tutorials as well. If you have done some work in Python regardless of how &quot;simple&quot; it is, we welcome your presentations. It's a great way to get rid of the stage shyness and be part of the community. 
</p>
